Standard PR template requiring:
- Description and type of change
- Related issues
- Testing checklist
- Performance and breaking change notes

---

## Setup Requirements

### Secrets

Configure these in repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub
- `NUGET_API_KEY` - (Optional) For NuGet package publishing

### Repository Settings

#### 1. Branch Protection Rules (recommended)
- Require PR reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass:
  - `build-and-test`
  - `code-quality`
  - `dependency-review`
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators

#### 2. Security
- Enable Dependabot alerts
- Enable Dependabot security updates
- Enable CodeQL scanning

#### 3. Actions Permissions
- Allow all actions and reusable workflows
- Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests (for automation)

### CheapHelpers Dependency

All workflows check out the CheapHelpers repository from `CheapNud/CheapHelpers`. Ensure:
- The repository exists and is accessible
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` has read access to the repository
- If private, configure a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope

All workflows include this step to check out the dependency:

```yaml
- name: Checkout CheapHelpers dependency
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    repository: CheapNud/CheapHelpers
    path: CheapHelpers
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Potential Issues:**
- If CheapHelpers is a **private repository**, you may need a Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Add `CHEAPHELPERS_PAT` secret and use `token: ${{ secrets.CHEAPHELPERS_PAT }}`

### NuGet Package Caching

Implemented in `ci.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Cache NuGet packages
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.nuget/packages
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-nuget-${{ hashFiles('**/*.csproj') }}
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster restore times (10-20 seconds vs 2-3 minutes)
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- More reliable builds

---

## .NET 10.0 Support

All workflows use .NET 10.0 with the following configuration:

```yaml
- name: Setup .NET 10.0
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
  with:
    dotnet-version: '10.0.x'
    dotnet-quality: 'preview'
```

**Notes:**
- `dotnet-quality: 'preview'` enables RC/preview versions
- When .NET 10.0 is officially released, remove the `dotnet-quality` line
- All workflows use consistent .NET version through environment variable

**Platform-Specific Considerations:**
All workflows are configured for **Windows only** because:
1. Avalonia UI is the primary UI framework
2. `System.Management` (WMI) is Windows-specific
3. CUDA/TensorRT requires NVIDIA GPUs
4. VapourSynth installation is Windows-optimized

---

## Artifact Management

### Test Results

### Release Packages
- **Formats**: ZIP (standalone + framework-dependent)
- **Retention**: 90 days
- **Uploaded by**: `release.yml`
- **Includes**: SHA256 checksums for verification

---

## Release Process

### Creating a Release

**Method 1: Tag-based (Recommended)**
```bash
git tag -a v2.0.1 -m "Release version 2.0.1"
git push origin v2.0.1
```

**Method 2: Manual Workflow Dispatch**
1. Go to Actions → Release Build and Publish
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter version number (e.g., `2.0.1`)
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Release Artifacts
- `CheapShotcutRandomizer-v{VERSION}-win-x64-standalone.zip` (~100MB)
  - Self-contained, no .NET installation required
  - Single-file executable option enabled
- `CheapShotcutRandomizer-v{VERSION}-win-x64.zip` (~10MB)
  - Requires .NET 10.0 runtime
  - Smaller download
- `checksums.txt`
  - SHA256 hashes for both packages

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Current)
- **Project**: `CheapShotcutRandomizer.Tests`
- **Framework**: xUnit + BUnit + Moq + FluentAssertions
- **Coverage Collection**: Coverlet
- **Runs on**: Every push and PR

### Performance Optimization

#### Current Optimizations
1. **Parallel Jobs**: Build, quality checks, and dependency checks run in parallel
2. **NuGet Caching**: Restored packages are cached between runs
3. **Conditional Execution**: Benchmarks only run when needed
4. **Artifact Retention**: Short retention for build artifacts (7 days)

---

## Branch Protection

### Branch Protection Recommendations

Configure these rules in GitHub Settings:

#### For `master` Branch
**Required Status Checks:**
- `build-and-test (windows-latest, Debug)`
- `build-and-test (windows-latest, Release)`
- `code-quality`
- `dependency-check`
- `CodeQL Analysis`
- `dependency-review` (for PRs)

**Other Settings:**
- Require PR before merging
- Require 1 approval
- Dismiss stale reviews
- Require conversation resolution

#### For `dev` Branch
**Required Status Checks:**
- `build-and-test (windows-latest, Debug)`
- `build-and-test (windows-latest, Release)`

**Other Settings:**
- Require PR before merging
- Allow force pushes for feature branches

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: CheapHelpers Checkout Fails

**Error**: "Repository not found" or "Resource not accessible"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the repository path is correct: `CheapNud/CheapHelpers`
2. If private, create a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
3. Add token as `CHEAPHELPERS_PAT` secret
4. Update workflows to use:
   ```yaml
   token: ${{ secrets.CHEAPHELPERS_PAT }}
   ```

---

### Issue 2: .NET 10.0 Not Found

**Error**: "Version 10.0.x not found"

**Solutions:**
1. Check if .NET 10.0 is released
2. Verify `dotnet-quality: 'preview'` is set for RC/preview versions
3. Pin to specific version: `dotnet-version: '10.0.100-rc.2.24502.107'`

**Current Status:**
- Currently using RC/preview version
- `dotnet-quality: 'preview'` enables preview versions
- When released, remove `dotnet-quality` line

---

### Issue 3: Tests Fail on CI but Pass Locally

**Common Causes:**
1. Missing dependencies (FFmpeg, VapourSynth, etc.)
2. Platform-specific behavior (Windows vs Linux)
3. File path differences
4. Time zone or culture-specific issues

**Solutions:**
1. Mock external dependencies in tests
2. Use platform-conditional tests: `[SkippableFact]`
3. Use `Path.Combine()` for paths
4. Set explicit culture: `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`

---

### Issue 4: Coverage Report Missing

**Error**: Coverage report not generated

**Solutions:**
1. Verify tests are running successfully
2. Check coverlet is collecting coverage: `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`
3. Ensure ReportGenerator installation succeeds
4. Check artifact upload paths match report output
5. Verify `coverlet.collector` package is installed (already installed)

---

### Issue 5: Coverage Report Empty

**Error**: No coverage data collected

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `coverlet.collector` package is installed (already installed)
2. Check test command includes: `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`
3. Ensure tests are actually running
4. Check for test failures

---

### Issue 6: Release Workflow Doesn't Create Release

**Error**: Release not created on tag push

**Solutions:**
1. Verify tag matches pattern: `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v2.0.1`, not `2.0.1`)
2. Check workflow has `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions
3. Verify workflow file syntax is correct
4. Check Actions tab for error details

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Quality
- Ensure code is formatted before committing
- Run tests locally before pushing
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 2. Pull Requests
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Wait for all checks to pass
- Address review comments promptly
- Keep PRs reasonably sized (aim for size/S or size/M)

### 3. Release Process
- Create release from `master` branch
- Tag with semantic version: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Update version in csproj before tagging
- Test release packages before publishing

### 4. Security
- Review Dependabot PRs weekly
- Address CodeQL findings promptly
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Never commit secrets or credentials

---

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Build Success Rate**: Target >95%
2. **Average Build Time**: Target <10 minutes
3. **Test Pass Rate**: Target 100%
